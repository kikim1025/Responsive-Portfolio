                    Ki Kim graduated with B.S. in Bioengineering with minor in Computer Science from the University of Maryland on May 2017.
                    After receiving the B.S. degree, Ki had been working on Ph.D. in Bioengineering at Clemson University. 
                    However, Ki realized that his true passion was in programming and decided to switch career.
